* Fix euler_decomposition.  Currently it appears as if the inverse
  trigonometric functions sometimes pick the wrong signs for the Euler
  angles.  See if there is a more stable algorithm.

* Fix inverse propagators.  The inverse propagator is mostly correct,
  however I know the time intervals are shifted out of place.
	
* Lindblad master equations are still not implemented.
