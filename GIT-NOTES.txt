Notes about the GIT version control system
==========================================

* Clone (check out) a repository.  This repository is currently held
	at http://merrill.homenet.org/~true/git/qudy.git.
  
	``git clone http://merrill.homenet.org/~true/git/qudy.git``

* Add changes to the repository.  Even if the file is already stored
  on the repository, when a file is modified, it has to be explicitly
  added before each commit.
	
	``git add file``
	
* Commit changes to the repository
	
	``git commit``

	Optionally, git can recognize what files have been modified and
	automatically commit these changes as well.  This is the default
	behavior in subversion, cvs, etc.
	
	``git commit -a``

* Update your working copy to the most recent version (merge with the
  HEAD branch).  In git, updating is performed with the pull command.
	
	``git pull``
	``git pull http://merrill.homenet.org/~true/git/qudy.git``
