Packaging
=========

This file contains packaging instructions intended for developers not
familiar with the python distutils packaging utility.  This document
is intended to be a set of cursory notes, and not a complete
discussion of packaging standards.  For complete information, readers
are referred to the `distutils manual
<http://docs.python.org/distutils/index.html#distutils-index>`_.

Versioning 
---------- 

Package versions are set using the qudylib.version and qudylib.release
constants set in the main repository __init__.py file.  When preparing
a new version for release, update these constants to the appropriate
values.  The documentation and packaging scripts automatically update
to the value set in the qudylib module.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation system requires the sphinx documentation system.
Assuming the developer has properly installed the sphinx package on
their system, the documentation may be built using the makefile in the
`docs/` directory.

.. code-block:: sh

   cd docs
   make clean
   make html
   make latex


Source packages
---------------

``python setup.py sdist``
